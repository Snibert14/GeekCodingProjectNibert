My First Flutter project.

## software I used

-VS Code
-Xcode for the simulator
-Flutter (I noticed you all used flutter in the job description so I used it too.)

### Time to complete

Thursday to Monday: 0 hours (Traveled to a wedding without my laptop and had a canceled flight home)

Tuesday and Wednesday: 10 hours including installing all of the programs and then starting the actual build of the file. I have never built or done an app like this. I learned a lot and enjoyed it.

Thursday: a couple minutes to log on and submit. Hurricane Ian really put a damper in the time I could put into this.
